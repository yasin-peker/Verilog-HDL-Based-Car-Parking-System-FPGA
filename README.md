# Verilog-HDL-Based-Car-Parking-System-FPGA
This repository contains the Verilog HDL implementation of a Car Parking System running on an FPGA. The system is designed to manage car entry and exit through two sensors located at the entrance and exit of the car park. It allows registered users to enter the car park by entering their passwords and controls the traffic lights accordingly.
